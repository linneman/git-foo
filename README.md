# Git-Foo - Scripts for Managing Git Repositories

This repository collects utilities I wrote for working with Git and Android Repo.

## gf\_sync\_remote\_dir - Synchronizing Git Repositories from Remote Directory

Bash script  which scans remote  host for git repositories  and clones
respectively  fetches their content to a local directory.  The primary
usage  is for  backup purposes.  On contrast  to other  aproaches e.g.
rsync the backed up repositories stay intact in case of malformed data
on the remote side.

Invocation:

    ./gf_sync_remote_dir.sh -l <local backup root directory> \\
                            -h <host to fetch from> \\
                            -p [ssh port] <backup directories list>

## gf\_diff\_manifests - print diff log between two manifest files

Parses given [Android repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html)
manifest.xml files, walks through all git repositories declared inside
them and generates a diff log. This is especially usefull when for the
generation of a changelog introduced with a new software release.

Invocation: (from Android build root directory)

    ./gf_diff_manifests.sh <old_manifest> <new_manifest>

The manifest files are fetched from the directory .repo/manifests.
